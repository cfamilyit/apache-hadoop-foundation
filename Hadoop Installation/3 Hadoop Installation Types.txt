Hadoop Development
==================
Hadoop Installation
===================
Hadoop Installation Types:-
=========================
--> There are 3ways to install hadoop. They are:
1. Standalone/Local Mode
2. pSudo Distribution Mode 
3. Fully Distribution Mode 

Standalone/Local Mode:-
=====================
--> All Daemons runs on Single Machine and on Single JVM.
--> It uses Local Filesystem but not HDFS Filesystem.
--> It is not Distributed.
--> It is Only Development not for testing and not for production.
--> Main Advantage of Standalone/Local Mode is Debugging purpose.

pSudo Distribution Mode
=======================
--> In this mode all Daemons runs on Single Machine but on Multiple JVM's.
--> It uses HDFS Filesystem.
--> It is Distributed.
--> It is for Development but not for Testing and not for Production purpose.

Fully Distribution Mode
=======================
--> In this mode different deamons runs on different machines and different 
    JVM's.
--> It is uses HDFS Filesystem
--> It is for Development, Testing and Production.
--> It is Highly recomended to take all master daemons on separate machines
    both worker daemons on same machines, we will take multiple works.

Hadoop Installation Introduction
================================
Note:- Operating System should be installed.
--> There are 3 steps involves in Hadoop Installation
1. Pre-Installation Steps.
2. Installation Steps.
3. Post-Installation Steps.

Pre-Installation Steps:-
======================
1) We Install Java (Recomended is Java 8)
2) Passwordless SSH

Installation Steps:-
=================
1) We will Install Hadoop 
2) We will set HADOOP_HOME and PATH variable
3) We will verify Hadoop is installed or not 

Post-Installation Steps:-
=======================
1. Confiuring Hadoop configuration files
2. We will Format NameNode
