Hadoop Foundation
=================
HDFS Filesystem:-
===============
What is HDFS Filesystem?
=======================
--> HDFS means "Hadoop DIstributed Filesystem"
--> It supports unlimited storage and 
--> It supports parallel processing.
--> It is a Userspace Filesystem.

What is the difference between Operating System Filesystem(Local Filesystem)
and HDFS Filesystem?
==========================================================================
--> Operating System Filesystem starts as part operating system process 
--> We can increase or we cannot decrease size of Operating System filesize
--> But HDFS is a Userspace Filesystem, it will after operating system 
    started, It is a user process so we can increase or decrease hdfs 
	filesystem size

What is Block?
=============
--> Is a Chunk or peace of data.
--> When client loads data into hdfs filesystem, data divided into multiple
    blocks
--> each block placed in different machine.
--> The default block size is 
			until hadoop 1.x -- 64MB
			from hadoop 2.x -- 128MB
--> This is configurable, we can increase or we can decrease block size.			
    in hdfs-site.xml
	name:dfs.blocksize
	value:
--> We can increase as multiples of block size.
    64+64+64+64+64
	128+128+128+128
	
--> In Operating System block size is 4KB
    Latest Block 8KB

What is advantage of large block size?
-------------------------------------
--> reading/seeking time is very faster.	

What is Replication or What is Replication-Factor?
=================================================
--> Replication -- duplicate copy of block
--> Replication-Factor -- how many duplicate copies of block
--> By default hadoop create "3" replicas.
--> we can increase or decrease replication-factor.
    In hdfs-site.xml 
	name: fs.replication	
	value:3
--> The main advantage of replication is we can solve fault-tolerance
    even we can access hdfs filesystem if any machine down or fail or crash.
	
Under Replication:-
=================
--> The blocks under < Replication-Factor is called "Under Replicated Blocks"
--> Assume DataNode 3 is failed, blocks under failed node comes into 
    "Under Replication"
--> NameNode maintains underplicated blocks information in NameNode machine.
--> Then NameNode will ask DataNode machines to replicate "underplicated
    blocks"
--> Assume DataNode1 accepted to replicate "b3" and DataNode2 accepted to 
    replicate block1.
--> At any point of time NameNode tries to maintain replication-factor.	

Over Replication:-
================
--> The blocks which are > replication is called "Over Replicated" blocks.
--> NameNode will ask 
    For Block1 -- DataNode1,2,3 and 5 to remove block1
	For Block3 -- DataNode1,3,4 and 5 to remove block1
	Assume DataNode 3 accepted to remove Block 1, 3
--> At any point of time NameNode tries to maintain replication-factor.	

HDFS Write Flow:-
===============
--> When Client Wants write file into HDFS Filesystem client will perform
    HDFS Write Flow.
--> First Client Communicates with NameNode and gets the blocks and DataNodes
    information and writes into HDFS Filesystem.	
	
HDFS Read Flow:-
==============
--> When Client to read HDFS Filesystem
    May HDFS CLI Command
	    MapReduce,
		Pig
		Hive
		etc..
--> First Clinet Communicates with NameNode and gets Filesystem metadata
--> NameNode return Metadata like 
    f1--b1--1,3,5
    f1--b2--2,4,6
    f1--b3--3,4,5   
--> Client reads
      b1 from DataNode1
      b2 from DataNode2
      b3 from DataNode3
